# Mermaid's Protector RPG

Mermaid's Protector RPG is an RPG game where you have to farm enemies to protect the mermaid queen. The game includes fights against registered players in Discord and worldwide battles.

## Gameplay

The game is based on commands that you can use in Discord. Here are the available commands:

- `!create`: You can create your character, and you can choose between warrior, archer, and mage.
- `!profile`: You can see your progress, level, experience, and statistics.
- `!farm`: You can fight against enemies in different zones.
- `!shop`: You can use your fragments to improve your stats.

Be careful which enemies you face, as if you die, you will have to wait an hour before you can play again!

## Design

To play the game, you need to have a Discord account and join the server where the game is hosted. Once you are in the server, you can use the commands described above to play the game.
